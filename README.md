This is the GitHub repository for the paper:

Clink DJ, Kim J, Cross-Jaya H, Ahmad AH, Hong M, Sala R, Birot H, Agger
C, Vu TT, Thi HNT, Chi TN, and H. Klinck (under review). Automated
detection of gibbon calls from passive acoustic monitoring data using
convolutional neural networks in the ‘torch for R’ ecosystem.

This repo relies on the ‘gibbonNetR’ package that can be installed from
GitHub using the following code.

``` r
# If you don't have devtools installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install gibbonNetR
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/gibbonNetR")
```
